          Warning: This article is really only relevant to you if you’ve seen the movie Fried Green Tomatoes (1991) and have a reasonable memory of it.
Ever since I saw Fried Green Tomatoes many moons ago, I considered it one of my semi-favorite movies. Probably not in my top 10, but definitely in my top 20. However, something has always bothered me about it.
The primary character of Fried Green Tomatoes is Idgie Threadgoode.
